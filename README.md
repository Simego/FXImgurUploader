# FXImgurUploader

**The new ImgurUploader is made with JavaFX (no swing), uses Java 8 but is a little faster, a lot better and much prettier, many improvements to be made since it's not finished and code to be rewritten.**

*(this project started as a test so with time many stuff will be rewritten, for example the main class holds everything of the main application and UI/config building)*
