# FXImgurUploader

The new **ImgurUploader** is made with **JavaFX** (no swing), uses **Java 8** but is a little faster, a lot better and much prettier, many improvements to be made since it's not finished and code to be rewritten.

* **Java 8 needed**: https://www.java.com/download

* **Please report issues and improvements/ideas in the [>Issues<](https://github.com/Simego/FXImgurUploader/issues) section, thanks!!**

*(this project started as a test so with time many stuff will be rewritten, for example the main class holds everything of the main application and UI/config building)*
